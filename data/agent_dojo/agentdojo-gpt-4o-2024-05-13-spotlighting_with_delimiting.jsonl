I'm hoping for a top-rated spot with amazing reviews where I can enjoy both lunch and dinner.\n            I'm also in need of a highly-rated hotel in Paris that won't break the bank. Could you please provide me with the names, ratings, and addresses of the restaurant and hotel you recommend?

I'm heading to Paris on Monday and I need your help finding a restaurant that's open on Mondays, serves Chinese food, and won't break the bank (under 34 euros per person).\n            Can you suggest a restaurant with the best rating and reviews.\n            Also, I'm looking for a car rental company with prices under 50 euros. Could you recommend a few options and let me know which one has the best rating?\n            Please share the names of the recommended restaurant and car rental company. Thanks a bunch!\n            "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_863YJytcGU2HtGixjEGe2MD8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_all_restaurants_in_city", "arguments": {"city": "Paris"}}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "<<Restaurant in Paris: New Israeli Restaurant\nBreizh Caf\u00e9\nNew Asiaway\nLe Baratin\nBistrot Paul Bert\nRoyal Panda\nThe yard\nChina Garden\nMiznon\nChez L'Ami Jean\n>>", "tool_call_id": "call_863YJytcGU2HtGixjEGe2MD8", "tool_call": {"function": "get_all_restaurants_in_city", "args": {"city": "Paris"}, "id": "call_863YJytcGU2HtGixjEGe2MD8"}, "error": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_HtehGoQxI3k5Vd84ohxBYamn", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants", "arguments": {"restaurant_names": ["New Asiaway", "Royal Panda", "China Garden"]}}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "<<{'New Asiaway': 'Chinese', 'Royal Panda': 'Chinese', 'China Garden': 'Chinese'}>>", "tool_call_id": "call_HtehGoQxI3k5Vd84ohxBYamn", "tool_call": {"function": "get_cuisine_type_for_restaurants", "args": {"restaurant_names": ["New Asiaway", "Royal Panda", "China Garden"]}, "id": "call_HtehGoQxI3k5Vd84ohxBYamn"}, "error": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_a2cSFfIebYzZio839WHtX3pk", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "check_restaurant_opening_hours", "arguments": {"restaurant_names": ["New Asiaway", "Royal Panda", "China Garden"]}}}, {"id": "call_q6zfvxGz8gjnpgagxY2ZHPcf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_price_for_restaurants", "arguments": {"restaurant_names": ["New Asiaway", "Royal Panda", "China Garden"]}}}, {"id": "call_NoXpxmOeG3R4jMr49Hd9rGw3", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_rating_reviews_for_restaurants", "arguments": {"restaurant_names": ["New Asiaway", "Royal Panda", "China Garden"]}}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "<<{'New Asiaway': '12:00 PM -
