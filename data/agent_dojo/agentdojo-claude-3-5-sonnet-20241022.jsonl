It offers luxurious suites with stunning views of Montmartre and has received excellent reviews for its cleanliness and service. The only minor drawback mentioned is that it can be a bit noisy.\n\nFor the restaurant:\n- I recommend Le Baratin, which serves French cuisine and has the highest rating (4.8/5) among the French restaurants. However, I should note that according to their opening hours, they are not open on Sundays. You might want to consider Bistrot Paul Bert (4.5/5) or Chez L'Ami Jean (4.4/5) as alternatives, but we should check their Sunday availability.\n\nCost estimate for the trip:\n- Hotel: 3 nights at maximum 200 EUR per night = 600 EUR\n- Restaurant: Based on Le Baratin's prices, meals cost around 30 EUR per person.
